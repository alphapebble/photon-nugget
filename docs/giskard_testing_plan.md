# Giskard Testing Plan for Solar Sage

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating Giskard, an open-source testing framework specifically designed for AI/ML models, into the Solar Sage project. Giskard will help detect issues like bias, performance problems, and security vulnerabilities in our RAG system and LLM integration.

## Why Giskard?

Giskard provides several benefits for AI-powered applications like Solar Sage:

1. **Specialized AI Testing**: Traditional testing frameworks aren't designed for the unique challenges of testing AI systems. Giskard fills this gap.

2. **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential biases in model responses, ensuring solar recommendations are fair and accurate.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks model performance over time, helping identify degradation.

4. **Explainability**: Provides tools to understand model decisions, which is important for a system providing solar recommendations.

5. **Integration with CI/CD**: Can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Tests

1. **Install Giskard**:
   ```bash
   pip install giskard
   ```

2. **Create Testing Directory Structure**:
   ```
   tests/
   ├── giskard/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── test_rag_model.py
   │   ├── test_weather_integration.py
   │   ├── test_agent_responses.py
   │   └── test_data/
   │       ├── solar_queries.json
   │       └── expected_responses.json
   ```

3. **Define Test Datasets**:
   - Create a set of standard solar-related queries
   - Define expected response characteristics
   - Include edge cases and potential problematic queries

4. **Implement Basic Test Suites**:
   - RAG system tests
   - Weather integration tests
   - Agent response tests
   - Factual accuracy tests

### Phase 2: Advanced Testing

1. **Bias and Fairness Testing**:
   - Test for geographical bias in solar recommendations
   - Test for economic bias in ROI calculations
   - Test for technical bias in system recommendations

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Quality degradation detection
   - Consistency across different queries

3. **Robustness Testing**:
   - Test with malformed queries
   - Test with adversarial inputs
   - Test with edge case weather conditions

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the entire pipeline from query to response
   - Test the dual-agent architecture
   - Test tool usage and selection

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration and Monitoring

1. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add Giskard tests to GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up automatic testing on PRs
   - Define quality gates based on test results

2. **Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - Set up a dashboard for tracking model performance
   - Implement alerts for performance degradation
   - Track key metrics over time

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Use test results to improve prompts
   - Refine the RAG system based on test insights
   - Expand test coverage based on user feedback
