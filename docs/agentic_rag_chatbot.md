# Solar Sage Agentic RAG Chatbot

## Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture and implementation details for extending the Solar Sage application into a fully agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot. The agentic capabilities will enable the system to not only provide information but also take actions on behalf of users, make decisions, and interact with external systems.

## Architecture

The Agentic RAG Chatbot builds upon the existing Solar Sage architecture, extending it with:

1. **Tool Integration Framework**: A system for defining, registering, and executing tools
2. **Agent Decision Engine**: Logic for determining when to use tools vs. providing information
3. **Memory System**: Short and long-term memory for maintaining conversation context
4. **Action Execution Pipeline**: Secure execution of user-authorized actions

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Engine

The Agent Engine is the central component that orchestrates the agentic capabilities:

```python
class AgentEngine:
    def __init__(self, llm, tool_registry, memory_system):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tool_registry = tool_registry
        self.memory_system = memory_system
        
    def process_query(self, query, user_context):
        # 1. Analyze query to determine if it requires tool use
        # 2. If tool use is needed, select appropriate tool
        # 3. Execute tool with appropriate parameters
        # 4. Process tool results and generate response
        # 5. Update memory with interaction
        pass
```

### 2. Tool Registry

The Tool Registry manages the available tools and their specifications:

```python
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
        
    def register_tool(self, tool_name, tool_function, tool_description, required_params):
        self.tools[tool_name] = {
            "function": tool_function,
            "description": tool_description,
            "required_params": required_params
        }
        
    def get_tool(self, tool_name):
        return self.tools.get(tool_name)
        
    def list_tools(self):
        return [{"name": name, "description": tool["description"]} 
                for name, tool in self.tools.items()]
```

### 3. Memory System

The Memory System maintains conversation history and user preferences:

```python
class MemorySystem:
    def __init__(self, storage_backend):
        self.storage = storage_backend
        
    def add_interaction(self, user_id, query, response, tools_used=None):
        # Store interaction in memory
        pass
        
    def get_recent_interactions(self, user_id, limit=5):
        # Retrieve recent interactions
        pass
        
    def store_user_preference(self, user_id, preference_key, preference_value):
        # Store user preference
        pass
```

### 4. Weather Integration

Enhanced weather integration for solar-specific insights:

```python
class WeatherToolkit:
    def __init__(self, weather_api_client):
        self.weather_client = weather_api_client
        
    def get_production_forecast(self, lat, lon, system_capacity_kw=5.0):
        # Get weather data and calculate production forecast
        pass
        
    def get_maintenance_recommendations(self, lat, lon):
        # Generate maintenance recommendations based on weather
        pass
        
    def get_optimal_production_times(self, lat, lon, days_ahead=7):
        # Identify optimal production times based on forecast
        pass
```

## Implemented Tools

   - Estimate system size based on energy needs
   - Recommend inverter configurations

3. **Performance Analysis Tool**
   - Analyze uploaded SCADA data
   - Compare actual vs. expected production
   - Identify performance issues

4. **Notification Tool**
   - Schedule weather alerts
   - Set up production monitoring alerts
   - Configure maintenance reminders

5. **External Integration Tool**
   - Connect to smart home systems
   - Interface with inverter monitoring APIs
   - Export data to external analytics platforms

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Weather-Based Production Forecast

```
User: What will my solar production be like this week?

System: [Identifies query as requiring the Weather Analysis Tool]
[Retrieves user's system information from memory]
[Executes weather forecast tool with user's location]
[Generates production forecast]

Response: Based on the weather forecast for your location (37.7749, -122.4194), 
I estimate your 5kW system will produce:
- Today: 22.4 kWh (90% of optimal) - Sunny conditions
- Tomorrow: 18.7 kWh (75% of optimal) - Partly cloudy
- Wednesday: 12.5 kWh (50% of optimal) - Cloudy with rain
...
The best production day will be today with clear skies and moderate temperatures.
```

### Example 2: Maintenance Recommendation

```
User: Should I clean my solar panels this week?

System: [Identifies query as requiring the Weather Analysis Tool]
[Retrieves user's maintenance history from memory]
[Executes maintenance recommendation tool]

Response: Based on your location's weather forecast, I don't recommend cleaning 
your panels this week. There's rain expected on Thursday which will naturally 
clean your panels. Your last recorded cleaning was 3 weeks ago, and the current 
dust accumulation is likely minimal. I'll remind you to check again in 2 weeks.
```

## Security Considerations

1. **User Authorization**: All actions require explicit user authorization
2. **Data Privacy**: User data is stored securely and not shared with external systems
3. **API Security**: All external API calls use secure authentication methods
4. **Action Logging**: All agent actions are logged for audit purposes

## Deployment

The Agentic RAG Chatbot can be deployed using the existing deployment infrastructure:

```bash
# Build with agent capabilities enabled
docker build -t solar-sage-agent .

# Run with agent configuration
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8502:8502 \
  -e ENABLE_AGENT=true \
  -e OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e TOOL_AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED=true \
  solar-sage-agent
```

## Conclusion

The Solar Sage Agentic RAG Chatbot extends the existing application with powerful agent capabilities, enabling it to not only provide information but also take actions to help users optimize their solar energy systems. By leveraging the existing RAG and weather integration components, the agent can provide highly personalized and actionable insights.
