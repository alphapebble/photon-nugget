## Next Steps

To continue the implementation of the Solar Sage Agentic RAG Chatbot, the following immediate steps are recommended:

1. **Implement Tool Registry**
   - Create `agents/tool_registry.py` based on the implementation guide
   - Implement tool registration and execution mechanisms
   - Add unit tests for the Tool Registry

2. **Implement Memory System**
   - Create `agents/memory_system.py` based on the implementation guide
   - Implement conversation history and user preferences storage
   - Add unit tests for the Memory System

3. **Implement Agent Engine**
   - Create `agents/agent_engine.py` based on the implementation guide
   - Implement tool decision logic and execution
   - Integrate with existing RAG system
   - Add unit tests for the Agent Engine

4. **Integrate Weather Tools**
   - Finalize the implementation of `tools/weather_tools.py`
   - Register weather tools with the Tool Registry
   - Test weather tool functionality

## Technical Debt and Considerations

The following items should be addressed during implementation:

1. **API Key Management**
   - Implement secure storage and retrieval of API keys
   - Add support for rotating keys

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for all agent actions
   - Add user-friendly error messages

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize tool execution for performance
   - Implement caching for frequently used data

4. **Security**
   - Ensure all user data is securely stored
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Conclusion

The Solar Sage Agentic RAG Chatbot project has a solid foundation with existing weather integration and RAG components. The architecture and implementation plans have been documented in detail, and a sample weather tool implementation has been provided.

The next steps involve implementing the core agent framework components (Tool Registry, Memory System, and Agent Engine) followed by the integration of various tools and UI enhancements. By following the roadmap and implementation guide, the development team can systematically transform the existing Solar Sage application into a fully agentic chatbot that provides actionable insights and automated assistance for solar energy system owners.
