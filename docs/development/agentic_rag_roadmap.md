## Conclusion

The Solar Sage Agentic RAG Chatbot project builds upon the solid foundation of the existing Solar Sage application, extending it with powerful agent capabilities. By following this roadmap, the development team can systematically implement the required components to transform the application into a fully agentic chatbot that provides not just information but actionable insights and automated assistance for solar energy system owners.

The project leverages the existing weather integration and RAG components while adding new agent capabilities, tools, and UI enhancements. With proper implementation and testing, the resulting system will provide significant value to users by helping them optimize their solar energy systems based on weather conditions, system configuration, and performance data.
