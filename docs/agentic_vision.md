# Solar Sage Agentic System Roadmap

This document outlines the planned architecture and components for transforming Solar Sage into a truly agentic system. Unlike the current implementation, which is primarily an enhanced RAG system with specialized components, the goal is to build a system with genuine agency capabilities.

## What Makes a System "Agentic"

A truly agentic system should have the following key characteristics:

1. **Autonomy**: Can operate independently without constant human guidance
2. **Tool Use**: Can select and use tools to accomplish tasks
3. **Planning**: Can formulate multi-step plans to achieve goals
4. **Decision Making**: Can make decisions based on context and goals
5. **Persistence**: Maintains state and can continue tasks over time
6. **Self-improvement**: Can learn from past interactions

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current State
- Dual-agent architecture with specialized components
- Weather data integration
- RAG capabilities for information retrieval
- Basic tool registry structure

### Target State
- Autonomous decision-making system
- Dynamic tool selection and execution
- Multi-step planning capabilities
- Persistent memory and state management
- Self-directed actions and learning

## Planned Architecture

```

## Key Components to Implement

### 1. Agent Orchestrator

The Agent Orchestrator will be the central coordinator of the agentic system, responsible for:

- Receiving and interpreting user requests
- Delegating tasks to specialized agents
- Monitoring execution and handling errors
- Providing feedback to the user

```python
# Skeleton structure
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.planner_agent = PlannerAgent()
        self.memory_agent = MemoryAgent()
        self.execution_agent = ExecutionAgent()
        self.tool_registry = ToolRegistry()
    
    def process_request(self, user_request, user_id):
        # 1. Analyze request
        # 2. Retrieve relevant context and history
        # 3. Generate a plan
        # 4. Execute the plan
        # 5. Update memory
        # 6. Return results
```

### 2. Planner Agent

The Planner Agent will be responsible for breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps:

- Analyzing user requests to identify goals
- Creating multi-step plans to achieve those goals
- Selecting appropriate tools for each step
- Adapting plans based on execution feedback

```python
# Skeleton structure
class PlannerAgent:
    def __init__(self, plan_library):
        self.plan_library = plan_library
    
    def create_plan(self, goal, context, available_tools):
        # 1. Analyze goal
        # 2. Check for similar plans in library
        # 3. Break down into steps
        # 4. Assign tools to steps
        # 5. Return executable plan
```

### 3. Memory Agent

The Memory Agent will manage persistent state and learning:

- Storing conversation history
- Maintaining user preferences and settings
- Tracking task progress across sessions
- Learning from past interactions

```python
# Skeleton structure
class MemoryAgent:
    def __init__(self, memory_store):
        self.memory_store = memory_store
    
    def retrieve_relevant_memories(self, context, query):
        # Retrieve memories relevant to current context
    
    def store_interaction(self, user_id, interaction_data):
        # Store new interaction data
    
    def update_user_model(self, user_id, new_information):
        # Update user model based on new information
```

### 4. Execution Agent

The Execution Agent will handle the actual execution of plans:

- Executing individual steps in a plan
- Handling tool selection and invocation
- Managing error recovery
- Providing progress updates

```python
# Skeleton structure
class ExecutionAgent:
    def __init__(self, tool_registry):
        self.tool_registry = tool_registry
    
    def execute_plan(self, plan, context):
        # 1. Initialize execution state
        # 2. For each step in plan:
        #    a. Select appropriate tool
        #    b. Execute tool with parameters
        #    c. Handle results or errors
        # 3. Return execution results
```

### 5. Enhanced Tool Registry

The Tool Registry will be expanded to support dynamic tool discovery and selection:

- Tool registration with capabilities and requirements
- Tool discovery based on task needs
- Tool execution with proper parameter handling
- Tool performance tracking

```python
# Skeleton structure
class ToolRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = {}
    
    def register_tool(self, tool_name, tool_function, capabilities, requirements):
        # Register a tool with its capabilities and requirements
    
    def discover_tools(self, task_requirements):
        # Find tools that match the requirements of a task
    
    def execute_tool(self, tool_name, parameters):
        # Execute a tool with the given parameters
```

## Planned Tools

1. **Weather Analysis Tool**
   - Get current and forecast weather data
   - Analyze impact on solar production
   - Generate maintenance recommendations

2. **System Configuration Tool**
   - Calculate optimal panel configurations
   - Estimate system size and production
   - Recommend equipment specifications

3. **Performance Analysis Tool**

## Success Metrics

A truly agentic system should be measured by:

1. **Autonomy Level**: Percentage of tasks completed without human intervention
2. **Tool Utilization**: Appropriate selection and use of available tools
3. **Plan Quality**: Effectiveness and efficiency of generated plans
4. **Adaptation**: Ability to handle unexpected situations
5. **User Satisfaction**: Perceived helpfulness and intelligence

## Conclusion

Transforming Solar Sage into a truly agentic system requires significant development beyond the current enhanced RAG implementation. This roadmap outlines the key components and phases needed to achieve genuine agency capabilities, enabling the system to autonomously plan, decide, and act to help users optimize their solar energy systems.
