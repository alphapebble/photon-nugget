  "What is solar net metering?": "Solar net metering is a billing mechanism that credits solar energy system owners for the electricity they add to the grid. When a solar system generates more electricity than the home or business uses during daylight hours, the excess electricity is sent to the grid, and the meter runs backward to provide a credit against the electricity that is consumed at night or during other periods when the system's output is lower than the building's usage. This allows customers to offset the cost of power drawn from the utility with excess power generated by their solar panels.",
  
  "How often should solar panels be cleaned?": "Solar panels generally require minimal maintenance, but cleaning frequency depends on your location and environmental conditions. In most areas, rain naturally washes away dust and debris. However, if you live in a particularly dusty area or where there's minimal rainfall, cleaning every 6-12 months may be beneficial. Areas with heavy pollen, near construction sites, or with bird droppings may require more frequent cleaning. You'll know it's time to clean when you notice a significant drop in energy production. Always clean panels during cool parts of the day to prevent thermal shock from cold water on hot panels.",
  
  "What is the recommended tilt angle?": "The recommended tilt angle for solar panels typically equals your geographical latitude. This maximizes annual energy production by optimizing the angle at which sunlight hits the panels throughout the year. For example, if you're located at 40° latitude, a 40° tilt would be optimal for year-round production. However, you might adjust this angle based on seasonal goals: steeper angles (latitude plus 15°) favor winter production, while shallower angles (latitude minus 15°) maximize summer output. Local factors like weather patterns and shading may also influence the ideal angle. For flat roofs or ground mounts, adjustable racking systems can help achieve optimal tilt.",
  
  "How do solar panels work?": "Solar panels work through the photovoltaic effect, where semiconducting materials like silicon convert sunlight directly into electricity. When sunlight hits the solar cells, it excites electrons in the silicon atoms, causing them to flow and generate direct current (DC) electricity. This DC electricity then passes through an inverter, which converts it to alternating current (AC) that can power homes and businesses. Multiple solar cells are connected together in a panel, and multiple panels form a solar array. The efficiency of this conversion depends on factors like panel type, orientation, and weather conditions.",
  
  "What factors affect solar panel efficiency?": "Solar panel efficiency is affected by multiple factors including panel technology (monocrystalline, polycrystalline, or thin-film), temperature (panels are less efficient in extreme heat), shading (even partial shade significantly reduces output), orientation and tilt angle (ideally facing south in the northern hemisphere with tilt equal to latitude), dirt and dust accumulation, age (panels degrade about 0.5-1% annually), weather conditions (cloud cover reduces direct sunlight), and time of day/season (affecting sun angle and intensity). System components like inverter quality and wiring also impact overall system efficiency.",
  
  "How does weather impact solar production?": "Weather significantly impacts solar production in several ways. Sunlight intensity is the primary factor—clear, sunny days produce maximum output while cloudy conditions can reduce production by 10-25% (though panels still generate some electricity). Temperature also matters; contrary to what many believe, solar panels actually perform better in cool, sunny conditions than in extreme heat, as high temperatures reduce panel efficiency. Seasonal changes affect production due to varying day length and sun angle. Snow can temporarily block panels but typically melts quickly due to the panels' dark surface. Heavy rain helps by cleaning dust from panels, though production is reduced during storms. Wind can help cool panels, potentially improving efficiency, but extreme weather events pose physical risks to the system."
