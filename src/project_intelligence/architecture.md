# Agentic Project Intelligence Layer Architecture

## System Overview

The Project Intelligence Layer is an AI-driven system that automatically extracts, processes, and structures project-related information from various communication channels and documents. It provides real-time insights and monitoring for project management without requiring manual input.

## Architecture Principles

- **Modular Design**: Components are decoupled and independently upgradable
- **Agentic Processing**: AI agents collaborate to extract, analyze, and structure information
- **Event-Driven**: System responds to new data events in real-time
- **Distributed Processing**: Workloads can be distributed across multiple nodes for scalability
- **Extensible**: New data sources, extraction methods, and visualization tools can be added easily

## Core Frameworks

- **LangGraph**: For orchestrating complex, branching workflows in the extraction and analysis process
- **CrewAI/AutoGen**: For agent teamwork and collaboration in processing project information
- **Ray**: For distributed, scalable processing of data ingestion and analysis tasks

## System Components

### 1. Data Connectors Layer

- **Email Connector**: Processes emails from IMAP/Gmail sources
- **Slack/Teams Connector**: Extracts messages from Slack and Microsoft Teams
- **Spreadsheet Connector**: Ingests data from Excel, Google Sheets, and CSV files
- **Document Connector**: Processes information from project documentation (future)
- **Issue Tracker Connector**: Interfaces with JIRA, GitHub Issues, etc. (future)

### 2. Agentic Extraction Layer

#### LangGraph Orchestration

The extraction process is orchestrated using LangGraph to handle the complex, branching nature of information extraction:

```
Project Detection → Task Extraction → Owner Assignment → Timeline Analysis → Resource Tracking
       ↓                  ↓                 ↓                   ↓                   ↓
   Validation        Deduplication      Verification       Normalization        Aggregation
```

#### Agent Crew Configuration (CrewAI/AutoGen)

A specialized crew of agents handles different aspects of project intelligence:

- **Project Detector Agent**: Identifies project names and scopes
- **Task Manager Agent**: Extracts and structures task information
- **Resource Tracker Agent**: Monitors resource allocation and availability
- **Timeline Agent**: Identifies dates, deadlines, and schedules
- **Risk Assessor Agent**: Identifies potential blockers and risks
- **Integration Agent**: Maps extracted information to existing project structures

### 3. Processing and Storage Layer

- **Ray-based Distributed Processing**: For scaling analysis across multiple nodes
- **Vector Database**: For semantic storage and retrieval of project information
- **Time-Series Database**: For tracking project metrics over time
- **Event Store**: For logging system activities and data provenance

### 4. Intelligence Layer

- **Project Status Analyzer**: Determines overall project health and status
- **Resource Optimizer**: Suggests optimal resource allocation
- **Risk Predictor**: Identifies potential future blockers based on patterns
- **Timeline Analyzer**: Detects schedule slippage and recommends adjustments
- **Performance Analyzer**: Identifies high and low-performing aspects of projects

### 5. Dashboard and Notification Layer

- **Real-time Dashboard**: Web-based visualization of project status
- **Alert System**: Proactive notifications for critical events
- **Integration APIs**: For connecting with other project management tools
- **Natural Language Interface**: For querying project status via chat

## Data Flow

1. **Ingestion**: Connectors continuously monitor data sources and detect new information
2. **Processing**: Raw data is processed by agent crews coordinated via LangGraph
3. **Analysis**: Structured data is analyzed to generate insights and detect patterns
4. **Storage**: Processed information is stored in appropriate databases
5. **Visualization**: Insights are presented through dashboards and notifications
6. **Feedback**: User interactions provide feedback to improve future processing

## Deployment Architecture

The system can be deployed in three configurations:

1. **Single-Node Deployment**: All components run on a single server, suitable for small deployments
2. **Distributed Deployment**: Components distributed across multiple nodes for scalability
3. **Hybrid Cloud Deployment**: Core components on-premises with scaling capabilities in the cloud
